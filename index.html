        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Made up of elements which work together to provide content and the framework of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage for the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element contains information for our user to see when opening the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements to those respective parent elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements: The name of the element, ie p-tag for paragraphs, describe their content and the role they play on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Using semantic elements, whenever possible, is best practice.</li>
          <li>Element: refers to the entire element, while tags refer only to what is happening inside the angle brackets. Tag and element are used interchangably, but they are different.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: 1. inline CSS 2. internal CSS 3. external CSS</li>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declatations apply.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>Margin is a property that acts much like a margin in a word processing document. It represents space outside of the element.</li>
       <li>Padding is a property that adds space around the content inside of the element.</li>
       <li>The * selector is a rule that declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style declared.</li>
       <li>Combining multiple selectors, separated by a comma, is best practice if they will have the same styles applied.</li>
       <li>DRY coding, Do Not Repeat Yourself, is a principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce lines of code needed to be written.</li>
       <li>You must link your external CSS.style in the head element of your index.html in order to see the effects.</li>
       <li>class selectors are preceded with a period, ie .class , and all elements with that class selector in the html file will be styled accordingly.</li>
     </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project after changes are made.</li>
       <li>To access Git we use the command line, and the bash commands for git always start with "git"</li>
       <li>Git is great for tracking changes via your local environment, but to collaborate with others you need to use Github as well.</li>
       <li>After creating a new repository on Github, you use [git clone paste copied SSH value] in the CLI, to connect your Github and local computer.</li>
       <li>After creating the initial "Main" or "Master" Branch, you need to create a feature branch to work from. You never want to work from Main Branch.</li>
       <li>Create a feature branch by navigating to your project directory in the CLI</li>
       <li>...then type: [git checkout main] in the CLI, to assure you are in the Main branch</li>
       <li>...then type: [git pull origin main] in the CLI, to pull down newest version of the Main Branch.</li>
       <li>...then type: [git checkout -b featurebranchname] in the CLI. And you open VS code [code .] to work that new feature branch.</li>
       <li>After work is finished for that feature, type [git status] in the CLI to be sure you are still in the new branch you were working from.</li>
       <li>[git add -A] in the CLI, to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
       <li>[git commit -m "added code to whatever file"] in CLI, adds message describing the changes you made in the working branch.</li>
       <li>[git pull origin main] in CLI to pull the base (main> branch.</li>
       <li>[git push origin featurebranchname] in CLI, to send all staged changes to Github to be merged.
        <li> On Github you will then go to the Code tab and select the feature branch.</li>
        <li> Then, on Github you will go to the Pull Requests tab, create new pull request, and then Merge the pull request to the Main Branch and delete the feature branch.</li>
        <li>[git checkout main] in CLI, and then [git pull origin main] to update your local environment.</li>
        <li> Then you will close the issue on Github</li>
       </li>

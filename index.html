        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Made up of elements which work together to provide content and the framework of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage for the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element contains information for our user to see when opening the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements to those respective parent elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements: The name of the element, ie p-tag for paragraphs, describe their content and the role they play on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Using semantic elements, whenever possible, is best practice.</li>
          <li>Element: refers to the entire element, while tags refer only to what is happening inside the angle brackets. Tag and element are used interchangably, but they are different.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: 1. inline CSS 2. internal CSS 3. external CSS</li>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declatations apply.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>Margin is a property that acts much like a margin in a word processing document. It represents space outside of the element.</li>
       <li>Padding is a property that adds space around the content inside of the element.</li>
       <li>The * selector is a rule that declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style declared.</li>
       <li>Combining multiple selectors, separated by a comma, is best practice if they will have the same styles applied.</li>
       <li>DRY coding, Do Not Repeat Yourself, is a principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce lines of code needed to be written.</li>
       <li>You must link your external CSS.style in the head element of your index.html in order to see the effects.</li>
       <li>class selectors are preceded with a period, ie .class , and all elements with that class selector in the html file will be styled accordingly.</li>

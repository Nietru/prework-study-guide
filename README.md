# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal of creating this webpage was to keep an organized record of my learning journey throughout the prework learning modules.
I built this project to keep all of my notes in an organized place and familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
While creating the Prework study guide webpage, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. 
In addition, I learned how to navigate through Github and use my local machine to push things to Github through Git. It gave me some hands on experience.
